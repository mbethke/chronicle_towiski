# chronicle_towiski
Chronicle theme for blog.towiski.de

[Chronicle](https://github.com/skx/chronicle2) theme used on [my
blog](http://blog.towiski.de). Heavily based on the bs2 theme that comes with
Chronicle but rewritten to use XslateTT templates, replacing a lot of copy/paste
code with include files for consistency and ease of maintenance.

The master branch is meant to be used with the current chronicle2 release. See
the [gettext branch](https://github.com/mbethke/chronicle_towiski/tree/gettext)
for some localization features that still need my [chronicle
fork](https://github.com/mbethke/chronicle2)

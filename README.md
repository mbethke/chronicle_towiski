# chronicle_towiski
Chronicle theme for blog.towiski.de

[Chronicle](https://github.com/skx/chronicle2) theme used on [my
blog](http://blog.towiski.de). Heavily based on the bs2 theme that comes with
Chronicle but rewritten to use XslateTT templates, replacing a lot of copy/paste
code with include files for consistency and ease of maintenance.

This template's boilerplate is localized; currently there is support for
English, German, Spanish and Portuguese. You will need `make`` and the
`msgformat` utility from the gettext package to compile the l10n catalogs, only
English works without them.
